## Problem Description

Given two strings S1 and S2 of equal length, the task is to determine if S2 is a scrambled form of S1.

Scrambled string: Given string str, we can represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it into two non-empty substrings recursively.
Below is one possible representation of str = coder:
![alt text](image.png)
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children. 
Suppose, we choose the node co and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string ocder.
Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes der and er, it produces a scrambled string ocred.

Note: Scrambled string is not the same as an Anagram.
Print "Yes" if S2 is a scrambled form of S1 otherwise print "No".


## Examples

**Example:**

Consider the following graph:

```
      ocder
     / \
    oc   der
   / \
  o   c
```
**Input:** S1="coder", S2="ocder"
**Explanation:** ocder is a scrambled 
form of coder.
**Output:** Yes

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. You only need to complete the function isScramble() which takes two strings S1 and S2 as input and returns a boolean value.

Expected Time Complexity:  $O(N2)$.
Expected Auxiliary Space: $O(N2)$.

## Constraints

- S1.length = S2.length
- `S1.length<=31`
- S1 and S2 consist of lower-case English letters.

## Problem Explanation

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the Scrambled String process:

**Step 1 :** A scrambled string is defined based on recursive partitioning and swapping of substrings. Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation:

**Step 2 :** Binary Tree Representation:Given a string str, you can represent it as a binary tree by recursively partitioning it into two non-empty substrings.
**Step 3 :** For example, for the string "coder": You can split it into "co" and "der".
Each of these can be further split recursively, forming a binary tree structure.
**Step 4 :**Scrambling: A string S2 is a scrambled form of string S1 if S2 can be obtained by swapping the left and right children of some non-leaf nodes in the binary tree representation of S1.
For instance, "coder" can be scrambled to "ocder" by swapping "co" and "der", then further scrambling "co" to "oc".

## Solution Logic

**1.Base Cases:**If the lengths of the two strings are not equal, they cannot be scrambled forms of each other, so return false.
If the two strings are identical, they are trivially scrambled forms of each other, so return true.
If the length of the string is 1 and the strings are not equal, return false.
**2.Memoization:** Use a map mp to store already solved subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
The key for the map is a combination of the two strings, represented as s1 + " " + s2.
**3.Recursive Check:** Iterate over possible split points of the strings.
For each split point, there are two cases to consider:
1.Without swapping:
Compare the left part of s1 with the left part of s2 and the right part of s1 with the right part of s2.
2.With swapping:
Compare the left part of s1 with the right part of s2 and the right part of s1 with the left part of s2.
**4.Return Result:** If either of the conditions (with or without swapping) is satisfied, return true.
If none of the conditions are satisfied after checking all possible split points, store the result as false in the memoization map and return false.1.
