## Problem

A number n is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,

Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 1 2 6
Explanation: The first three factorial numbers are less than equal to n but the fourth factorial number 24 is greater than n. So we print only first three factorial numbers.
```

### Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **rotate()** which takes the array **A[]** and its size **N** as inputs and modify the array in place.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(K)$, Where K is the number of factorial numbers.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<=n<=10^{18}$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def factorialNumbers(self, n):
	factorial = 1
    factorials = []
    i = 1
    while factorial <= n:
        factorials.append(factorial)
        i += 1
        factorial *= i
    
    return factorials
```

### Java
```java
static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
    ArrayList<Long> factorials = new ArrayList<>();
    long factorial = 1;
    int i = 1;
    while (factorial <= n) {
        factorials.add(factorial);
        i++;
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorials;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
vector<long long> factorialNumbers(long long n) {
    vector<long long> factorials;
    long long factorial = 1;
    int i = 1;
    while (factorial <= n) {
        factorials.push_back(factorial);
        i++;
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorials;
}
```

### C
```c
long long factorialNumbers(long long n, long long *out, int *out_size) {
    long long factorial = 1;
    int i = 1;
    *out_size = 0;
    while (factorial <= n) {
        out[(*out_size)++] = factorial;
        i++;
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorial;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(K)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
