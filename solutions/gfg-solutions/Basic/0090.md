## Problem

Given a sorted array consisting 0s and 1s. The task is to find the index of first 1 in the given array.

NOTE: If one is not present then, return -1.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input : 
arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output : 
6
Explanation:
The index of first 1 in the array is 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input : 
arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 0}
Output : 
-1
Explanation:
1's are not present in the array.
```

### Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **firstIndex()** which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the index of first 1. If 1 is not present in the array then return -1.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(Log (N))$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<=N<=10^6$
- $0<=A_i<=1$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def firstIndex(self, arr, n):
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    first_one_index = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == 1:
            first_one_index = mid
            high = mid - 1  
        else:
            low = mid + 1   
    return first_one_index
```

### Java
```java
public long firstIndex(long arr[], long n) {
    long low = 0;
    long high = n - 1;
    long firstOneIndex = -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        long mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[(int)mid] == 1) {
            firstOneIndex = mid;
            high = mid - 1; 
        } 
        else {
            low = mid + 1; 
        }
    }
    return firstOneIndex;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int firstIndex(int a[], int n) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;
    int firstOneIndex = -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (a[mid] == 1) {
            firstOneIndex = mid;
            high = mid - 1; 
        } 
        else {
            low = mid + 1; 
        }
    }
    return firstOneIndex;
}
```

### C
```c
int firstIndex(int a[], int n) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;
    int firstOneIndex = -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (a[mid] == 1) {
            firstOneIndex = mid;
            high = mid - 1; 
        } 
        else {
            low = mid + 1; 
        }
    }
    return firstOneIndex;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(Log (N))$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
