## Problem

Given an integer array **Arr** of size **N**. For each element in the array, check whether the right adjacent element (on the next immediate position) of the array is smaller. If next element is smaller, update the current index to that element. If not, then  **-1**.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {4, 2, 1, 5, 3}
Output:
2 1 -1 3 -1
Explanation: Array elements are 4, 2, 1, 5, 3. Next to 4 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2. Next of 2 is 1 which is smaller, so we print 1. Next of 1 is 5 which is greater, so we print -1. Next of 5 is 3 which is smaller, so we print 3.  Note that for last element, output is always going to be -1 because there is no element on right.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 7}
Output:
-1 2 -1 1 -1 -1
Explanation: Next to 5 is 6 which is greater, so we print -1. Next of 6 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2. Next of 2 is 3 which is greater, so we print -1. Next of 3 is 1 which is smaller, so we print 1. Next of 1 is 7 which is greater, so we print -1. Note that for last element, output is always going to be -1 because there is no element on right.
```

### Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **immediateSmaller()** which takes the array of integers **arr** and **n** as parameters. You need to change the array itself.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<=N<=10^7$
- $1<=Arr[i]<=10^5$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def immediateSmaller(self,arr,n):
    for i in range(n - 1) :
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) :
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
        else :
            arr[i] = -1
    arr[n - 1] = -1
```

### Java
```java
void immediateSmaller(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        }
        else
            arr[i] = -1;
    }
    arr[n - 1] = -1;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
void immediateSmaller(vector<int>&arr, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        }
        else
            arr[i] = -1;
    }
    arr[n - 1] = -1;
}
```

### C
```c
void immediateSmaller(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        } else {
            arr[i] = -1;
        }
    }
    arr[n - 1] = -1;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
