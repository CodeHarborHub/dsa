## Problem

Given a street of N houses (a row of houses), each house having K amount of money kept inside; now there is a thief who is going to steal this money but he has a constraint/rule that he cannot steal/rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum money he can rob.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5 , K = 10
Output:
30
Explanation:
The Robber can rob from the first, third and fifth houses which will result in 30.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 2 , K = 12
Output:
12
Explanation:
The Robber can only rob from the first or second which will result in 12.
```

### Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **maximizeMoney()** which takes 2 Integers N and K as input and returns the answer.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(1)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1 <= N,K <= 10^3$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def maximizeMoney(self, N , K):
    return ((N+1)//2)*K;
```

### Java
```java
static int maximizeMoney(int N , int K) {
    return ((N+1)/2)*K;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int maximizeMoney(int N , int K) {
    return ((N+1)/2)*K;
}
```

### C
```c
int maximizeMoney(int N , int K) {
    return ((N+1)/2)*K;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
