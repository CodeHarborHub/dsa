## Problem

Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a square pattern with the help of *  such that each * is space-separated in each line.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
n = 3
Output:
* * *
* * *
* * *
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
n = 5
Output:
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

### Your task:

You don't need to input anything. Complete the function **printSquare()** which takes  an integer n  as the input parameter and print the pattern.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<= n <= 1000$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def printSquare(self, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            print("* ", end="")
        print()
```

### Java
```java
void printSquare(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            System.out.print("* ");  
        }
        System.out.println();  
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
void printSquare(int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";  
        }
        cout << endl;  
    }
}
```

### C
```c
void printSquare(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
