## Problem

Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.
```

### Your task:

Your task is to complete the given function **getCount()**, which takes a head reference as an argument and should return the length of the linked list.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<=N<=10^5$
- $1<=value<=10^3$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def getCount(self, head_node):
    temp = head_node
    count = 0
    while temp is not None:
        count+=1
        temp = temp.next
    return count
```

### Java
```java
public static int getCount(Node head) {
    Node temp = head;
    int count = 0;
    while(temp!=null) {
        count++;
        temp = temp.next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int getCount(struct Node* head){
    struct Node* temp = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        count++;
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### C
```c
int getCount(struct Node* head) {
    struct Node* temp = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        count++;
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
