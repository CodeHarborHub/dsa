## Problem

Given a linked list. Print all the elements of the linked list.

**Note:** End of Line is handled by driver code itself. You just have to end with a single space.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
LinkedList : 1 -> 2
Output:
1 2
Explanation:
The linked list contains two elements 1 and 2.The elements are printed in a single line.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
Linked List : 49 -> 10 -> 30
Output: 
49 10 30
Explanation:
The linked list contains 3 elements 49, 10 and 30. The elements are printed in a single line.
```

### Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **display()** which takes the head of the linked list as input and prints the linked list in a single line.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1 <= n <=10^5$
- $1 <=$ node values $<= 10^6$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def display(self,head):
    temp = head
    while temp is not None:
        print(temp.data, end = " ")
        temp = temp.next
```

### Java
```java
void display(Node head) {
    Node temp = head;
    while (temp != null) {
        System.out.print(temp.data + " ");
        temp = temp.next;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
void display(Node *head) {
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```

### C
```c
void display(struct Node *head) {
   struct Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", temp->data);
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
