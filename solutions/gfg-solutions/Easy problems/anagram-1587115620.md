## Problem Description

Given two strings `a` and `b` consisting of lowercase characters, the task is to check whether the two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, `act` and `tac` are an anagram of each other. Strings `a` and `b` can only contain lowercase alphabets.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "listen", b = "silent"
Output: YES
Explanation: The characters in both strings are the same.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "hello", b = "billion"
Output: NO
Explanation: The characters in the strings are different.
```

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `isAnagram()` which takes the strings `a` and `b` as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether the two strings are an anagram of each other.

Expected Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$ for sorting-based approach or $O(n)$ for counting-based approach.

Expected Auxiliary Space: $O(1)$ for constant extra space.

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 10^5`

## Problem Explanation

The problem is to check if two strings are anagram of each other, meaning both strings should have the same characters in any order.

  ```py
  class Solution:
      def isAnagram(self, a: str, b: str) -> bool:
          # If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
          if len(a) != len(b):
              return False
          
          # Sort and compare
          return sorted(a) == sorted(b)
  
  # Example usage
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      solution = Solution()
      print(solution.isAnagram("listen", "silent"))  # Expected output: True
      print(solution.isAnagram("hello", "billion"))  # Expected output: False
  ```

  ```cpp
  //{ Driver Code Starts
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;

  // } Driver Code Ends
  class Solution {
  public:
      // Function to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
      bool isAnagram(string a, string b) {
          // If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
          if (a.size() != b.size()) return false;

          // Sort both strings
          sort(a.begin(), a.end());
          sort(b.begin(), b.end());

          // Compare sorted strings
          return a == b;
      }
  };

  //{ Driver Code Starts.
  int main() {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      while(t--) {
          string c, d;
          cin >> c >> d;
          Solution obj;
          if (obj.isAnagram(c, d)) cout << "YES" << endl;
          else cout << "NO" << endl;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  // } Driver Code Ends

## Example Walkthrough

For the strings `a = "listen"` and `b = "silent"`:

1. Check the lengths of `a` and `b`. They are both 6.
2. Sort both strings: `a` becomes `eilnst` and `b` becomes `eilnst`.
3. Compare the sorted strings. They are equal, so the result is `YES`.

For the strings `a = "hello"` and `b = "billion"`:

1. Check the lengths of `a` and `b`. `a` is 5 and `b` is 7.
2. Since the lengths are different, the result is `NO`.

## Solution Logic:

1. Check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, they cannot be anagrams.
2. Sort both strings and compare them. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams.

## Time Complexity

* The sorting-based approach has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, where n is the length of the strings.

## Space Complexity

* The auxiliary space complexity is $O(1)$ for constant extra space.
