### Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Examples

#### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

#### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`

### Approach

Brute Force Approach : We have to move the last element to first for each k.
For each k, find the last element from the list. Move it to the first.

Letâ€™s take an example. 

head = [1,2,3,4,5] k = 2000000000

If we see a brute force approach, it will take O(5*2000000000) which is not a good time complexity when we can optimize it.

We can see that for every k which is multiple of the length of the list, we get back the original list. Try to operate brute force on any linked list for k as a multiple of the length of the list.

This gives us a hint that for k greater than the length of the list, we have to rotate the list for k%length of the list. This reduces our time complexity.

Steps to the algorithm:-

1. Calculate the length of the list.
2. Connect the last node to the first node, converting it to a circular linked list.
3. Iterate to cut the link of the last node and start a node of k%length of the list rotated list.

### Solution Code

#### Python

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

# utility function to insert node at the end of the linked list
def insertNode(head, val):
    newNode = Node(val)
    if head == None:
        head = newNode
        return head
    temp = head
    while temp.next != None:
        temp = temp.next
    temp.next = newNode
    return head

# utility function to rotate list by k times
def rotateRight(head, k):
    if head == None or head.next == None or k == 0:
        return head
    # calculating length
    temp = head
    length = 1
    while temp.next != None:
        length += 1
        temp = temp.next
    # link last node to first node
    temp.next = head
    k = k % length  # when k is more than length of list
    end = length - k  # to get end of the list
    while end:
        temp = temp.next
        end -= 1
    # breaking last node link and pointing to NULL
    head = temp.next
    temp.next = None

    return head

# utility function to print list
def printList(head):
    while head.next != None:
        print(head.val, end='->')
        head = head.next
    print(head.val)
    return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    head = None
    # inserting Node
    head = insertNode(head, 1)
    head = insertNode(head, 2)
    head = insertNode(head, 3)
    head = insertNode(head, 4)
    head = insertNode(head, 5)

    print("Original list: ", end='')
    printList(head)

    k = 2
    # calling function for rotating right of the nodes by k times
    newHead = rotateRight(head, k)

    print("After", k, "iterations: ", end='')
    printList(newHead)  # list after rotating nodes
```

#### Java
```
//utility function to insert node at the end of the list
static Node insertNode(Node head,int val) {
    Node newNode = new Node(val);
    if(head == null) {
        head = newNode;
        return head;
    }
    Node temp = head;
    while(temp.next != null) temp = temp.next;
    
    temp.next = newNode;
    return head;
}
//utility function to rotate list by k times
static Node rotateRight(Node head,int k) {
    if(head == null||head.next == null||k == 0) return head;
    //calculating length
    Node temp = head;
    int length = 1;
    while(temp.next != null) {
        ++length;
        temp = temp.next;
    }
    //link last node to first node
    temp.next = head;
    k = k%length; //when k is more than length of list
    int end = length-k; //to get end of the list
    while(end--!=0) temp = temp.next;
    //breaking last node link and pointing to NULL
    head = temp.next;
    temp.next = null;
        
    return head;
}

//utility function to print list
static void printList(Node head) {
    while(head.next != null) {
        System.out.print(head.num+"->");
        head = head.next;
    } 
    System.out.println(head.num);
    
}
```

#### C++
```
//utility function to insert node at the end of the list
void insertNode(node* &head,int val) {
    node* newNode = new node(val);
    if(head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    node* temp = head;
    while(temp->next != NULL) temp = temp->next;
    
    temp->next = newNode;
    return;
}
//utility function to rotate list by k times
node* rotateRight(node* head,int k) {
    if(head == NULL||head->next == NULL||k == 0) return head;
    //calculating length
    node* temp = head;
    int length = 1;
    while(temp->next != NULL) {
        ++length;
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    //link last node to first node
    temp->next = head;
    k = k%length; //when k is more than length of list
    int end = length-k; //to get end of the list
    while(end--) temp = temp->next;
    //breaking last node link and pointing to NULL
    head = temp->next;
    temp->next = NULL;
        
    return head;
}

//utility function to print list
void printList(node* head) {
    while(head->next != NULL) {
        cout<<head->num<<"->";
        head = head->next;
    } 
    cout<<head->num<<endl;
    return;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis :

- Time complexity: O(length of list) + O(length of list - (length of list%k))

- Space complexity: O(1)
