## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from `0 to 9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path` 1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

![alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg)

```plaintext
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- `The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.`

## Solution
### Intuition

The intuition behind this solution is to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree using a queue. While traversing the tree level by level, we keep track of the current sum along the path from the root to each node. When we encounter a leaf node, we add its corresponding sum to the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

### Approach

1. Initialize a total sum variable to keep track of the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
2. Initialize two queues: one for storing the tree nodes and another for storing the corresponding sums.
3. Enqueue the root node and its value into the respective queues.
4. While there are nodes in the queue, dequeue a node and its corresponding sum.
5. If the dequeued node is a leaf node, add its sum to the total sum.
6. If the dequeued node has left or right children, enqueue them along with their corresponding sums (formed by appending the child nodeâ€™s value to the current sum multiplied by 10).
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty.
8. Return the total sum.


### C++

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    int totalSum = 0;

    void findSum(TreeNode* root, int currNum) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr)
            totalSum += (currNum * 10 + root->val);
        currNum = currNum * 10 + root->val;
        findSum(root->left, currNum);
        findSum(root->right, currNum);
    }

public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        findSum(root, 0);
        return totalSum;
    }
};
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    private int totalSum = 0;
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        findSum(root, 0);
        return totalSum;
    }
    private void findSum(TreeNode root, int currNum){
        if(root == null) return;
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) totalSum += (currNum * 10 + root.val);
        currNum = currNum * 10 + root.val;
        findSum(root.left, currNum);
        findSum(root.right, currNum);
    }
}
```




### Conclusion

### Complexity
- Time complexity:
Since we visit each node exactly once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Space complexity:
In the worst case, when the tree is a complete binary tree, both queues can hold up to O(n/2) nodes, resulting in O(n) space complexity. However, in the average case, the space complexity is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
