## Problem statement:

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, return the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subarray of `arr` that is closest to `k`.

The bitwise OR of an array of numbers is defined as `a1 | a2 | ... | an`, where `|` denotes the bitwise OR operator.

**Example 1:**

Input: arr = [5,6,7,8,9], k = 10
Output: 10

Explanation: The subarray [6,7] has bitwise OR = 6 | 7 = 7, which is closest to 10.

**Example 2:**

Input: arr = [1,2,4,8,16], k = 32
Output: 31

Explanation: The subarray [1,2,4,8,16] has bitwise OR = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 = 31, which is closest to 32.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i], k <= 10^9`

## Solutions:

### Approach 1: Sliding Window with Bitmasking

```python
class Solution:
    def closestToTarget(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = float('inf')
        current = set()
        
        for num in arr:
            current = {num & val for val in current} | {num}
            for val in current:
                ans = min(ans, abs(val - k))
        
        return ans
```

### Approach 2: Efficient Bitmasking with Set Operations

```python
class Solution:
    def closestToTarget(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = float('inf')
        current = set()
        next_set = set()
        
        for num in arr:
            next_set = {num & val for val in current} | {num}
            for val in next_set:
                ans = min(ans, abs(val - k))
            current = next_set
        
        return ans
```

### Approach 3: Optimized Sliding Window with Prefix Bitmasking

```python
class Solution:
    def closestToTarget(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = float('inf')
        current = set()
        
        for num in arr:
            new_current = {num}
            for val in current:
                new_current.add(val | num)
            current = new_current
            for val in current:
                ans = min(ans, abs(val - k))
        
        return ans
```
## Complexity Analysis:

### Approach 1: Sliding Window with Bitmasking

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n⋅log(max_element))$
  - Where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array `arr`, and `max_element` is the maximum element in `arr`.
  - The logarithmic factor comes from the bitwise operations and set operations involved.

- **Space Complexity:** $O(log(max_element))$
  - Space used by the set `current` to store intermediate bitwise OR values.

### Approach 2: Efficient Bitmasking with Set Operations

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n⋅log(max_element))$
  - Same as Approach 1, due to similar operations on sets.

- **Space Complexity:** $O(log(max_element))$
  - Similar to Approach 1, space used by the sets `current` and `next_set`.

### Approach 3: Optimized Sliding Window with Prefix Bitmasking

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n⋅log(max_element))$
  - Same as Approach 1 and 2, as it involves bitwise OR operations and set updates.

- **Space Complexity:** $O(log(max_element))$
  - Space used by the set `current` to store intermediate bitwise OR values.

Here, `max_element` refers to the maximum element present in the array `arr`, which affects the logarithmic factor in the time and space complexities due to bitwise operations and set operations involved in each approach.
