## Problem statement:

In a game, `n` children stand in a circle and pass a ball to each other. The child at position `i` passes the ball to the child at position `(i + 1) % n` after 1 second, and the child at position `0` starts with the ball.

You are given the number of children `n` and the number of seconds `k`. Return the index of the child who has the ball after `k` seconds.

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 5, k = 7
Output: 2

Explanation: The ball will be at child 2 after 7 seconds.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, k = 4
Output: 1

Explanation: The ball will be at child 1 after 4 seconds.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solutions:

### Approach 1:

**Intuition**

The ball passes from one child to the next every second. When the ball reaches the last child (at position `n-1`), it returns to the first child (at position `0`). This forms a repeating cycle of length `n`.

**Approach**

Calculate the position of the ball after `k` seconds by taking the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. This will give the current position in the cycle.

  int numberOfChild(int n, int k) {
    // the time for the ball to return to 0
    const int roundTime = 2 * (n - 1);
    const int pos = k % roundTime;
    return pos < n ? pos : roundTime - pos;
  }
};

    return pos < n ? pos : roundTime - pos;
  }

# Complexity Analysis:
## Approach 1:
### Time Complexity: $O(1)$

The time complexity is constant because we only need to perform a few arithmetic operations regardless of the size of $n$ and $k$.

### Space Complexity: $O(1)$

The space complexity is also constant because we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for the calculation.
