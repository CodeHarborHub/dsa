## Problem Description
Given two integers, `num` and `t`. A number is achievable if it can become equal to `num` after applying the following operation:

Increase or decrease the number by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.
Return the maximum achievable number after applying the operation at most `t` times.

### Example

**Example 1:**


```
Input: num = 4, t = 1

Output: 6

Explanation:

Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:

Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 3, t = 2

Output: 7

Explanation:

Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:

Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
```
### Constraints

- `1 <= num, t <= 50`

## Solution Approach

### Intuition:

To efficiently Find the Maximum Achievable Number

### Aproach
1. Define the problem: Determine the maximum achievable X given num and t.
2. Understand the relationship: Recognize that X increases by 2t for every num.
3. Formulate the solution: Return num + 2*t to calculate the maximum achievable X.
4. Implement the solution: Write the code in the desired programming language (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or Java).
5. Test and verify: Check the code with various inputs to ensure it produces the correct output.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: $$O(1)$$, meaning it takes constant time, regardless of the input size. This is because the method performs a simple arithmetic operation that doesn't depend on the size of the input.

- Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$, meaning the method uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size. This is because the method doesn't allocate any new memory that scales with the input size.
