6. **[Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)** - Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

7. **[Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)** - Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

8. **[Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)** - Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

9. **[Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)** - Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

10. **[Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)** - All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', finds all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

11. **[Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)** - Given a range [m, n], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

12. **[UTF-8 Validation](https://leetcode.com/problems/utf-8-validation/)** - A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.

13. **[Total Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/)** - The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

14. **[Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/)** - A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
